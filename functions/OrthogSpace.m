function [e, B, I] = OrthogSpace(v)
% Consider k vectors v_i in R^n. This function finds n-k vectors e_i which
% are orthogonal to the v_i and mutually orthogonal. The v_i are also
% orthogonalised in the process.
%
% Input:
%
% v: k vectors, enter as v = [v_1, v_2, ..., v_k]
%
% Outputs:
%
% e: basis vectors e = [e_1, ..., e_{N-k}]
% B: full orthonormal basis of R^n
% I: position of elements of e within B

% Note: the v_i are extended to a full basis by including elements of the
% standard basis. The v_i only replace elements they have a component in.
% This basis is then converted to an orthonormal one using the Gram-Schmidt
% process.
